    "intro": "Where Technical Excellence Meets Holistic Awareness",
    "description": "**2009-2017: Mastery** | Computer Engineering at UPC Barcelona. Progressed from backend engineer (MRW, PWC) to frontend leadership (MoveBubble) to CTO (Tinto). Specialized in React Native, TypeScript, scalable architectures. Discovered my calling: not just building products, but cultivating the humans who build them.\n\n**2017-2023: Integration** | After years in high-pressure tech, I made an unconventional choice: a structured sabbatical to develop conscious leadership. 500+ hours formal training in facilitation, coaching, embodiment practices. Maintained technical edge building wellness apps. Explored blockchain, smart contracts, and AI integration. Emerged with rare integration: technical excellence + human wisdom.\n\n**2023-Present: Contribution** | Returned to tech leadership (Hostology) with both skillsets intact. Now building products AND cultures that thrive. Developing wellness technology with AI integration. Architecting DAO governance for regenerative communities (Proyecto Salvaje). Advising conscious companies on Web3, AI, and holistic leadership.\n\n**What I Bring:** The analytical precision of a senior engineer. The systems thinking of a CTO. The presence and wisdom of a seasoned facilitator. Emerging tech expertise (blockchain, AI). The rare ability to hold both technical excellence and human flourishing.",
