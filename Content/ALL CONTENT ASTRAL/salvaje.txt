Our Vision
A Regenerative Vision for Sovereign Living

Creation of an intentional regenerative community dedicated to protecting human integrity and sovereign birthrights: freedom, bodily autonomy, spiritual self-determination, and the right to live in harmony with nature.

A regenerative, heart-led social project dedicated to future generations and the defense of human integrity. A community made to radiate outward and plant seeds of change, rather than being an isolated bubble.

Community-Driven Growth
Stepping out of the over-capitalization of the wellness industry by prioritizing community-driven growth, equitable access, and mutual support over profit.

Human-Centered Healing
A third way focused on the human factor — on how to heal and support each other as we live in reciprocity with the Earth, grounded in dignity and remembrance of the sacred.

Indigenous Wisdom
Sustainable ways to engage in a decolonized dialogue with indigenous communities and repressed minorities, reclaiming a grounded approach to the sacred.

Sovereignty & Autonomy
Redefining togetherness and enhancing self-sufficiency and sovereignty without reliance on external power structures or obedience to overarching governmental systems.

The Sacred Land
The Land Calling Us Home

The project is being birthed in Mexico, a country that upholds a very powerful energy of social resistance, indigenous rights, and integrity, and that holds weight on the global political scene for defending minorities.

This land is surrounded by agricultural fields with old trees and rich soil. It's an area rich in culture and history, with the presence of ocean, lagoon, and mangroves — a place that already hosts various collective initiatives, healing centers, and land regeneration projects.

"The land is nestled in front of a natural reserve… offering privacy and deep peace — being both protected and connected."
